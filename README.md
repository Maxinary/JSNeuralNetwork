# JSNeuralNetwork
An interactive neural network simulator in Javascript.
######Note: This is an interactive visual for a *static* neural network, not an evolving one.
##Abilities
This can render neural networks and allows for the user to see how a change in the inputs will affect the output by clicking on the inputs. It can also "focus" on a single neuron and all of its inputs as to better understand how the system works.

#####The file main.js is doing the heavy lifting. All of the other files are drivers.
